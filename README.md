# K-12-Tutoring-RCT
## This was a part of a PhD level economics class on designing field experiments. As my final project I designed a full scale RCT that provided tutoring to students in elementary and middle schools. Its goal was to measure spillover effects of tutoring to students in the class. 


## The project highlights knowledge of: 
* Statisical inference with regards to an RCT (calculating power, exploiting spillovers, handling attrition, and measuring detecable effects under small randomization blocks)
* Planning/rollout of a national, multi-site RCT (detailed time line to run research trial, collect data, and run analysis)
* Funding and calculating the true cost of running a long term research study.
